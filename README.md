# Linksnip - Copy a shortened address of the current page

Linksnip is a Chrome extension that will copy a shortened address for
the current page.  Ideally, this will support most popular services
that have a shortened form (like `youtube.com` links to `youtu.be`).
This extension does not operate with URL shortening services.  It only
computes the new URL from the existing one.

To use, click on the extension button.  A shortened URL will be copied
into the clipboard. If the extension doesn't know how to shorten a
URL, the whole address will be copied.

This extension requires access to :

- your tabs (to get the page address)
- write access to your clipboard (to put the page address in there)
