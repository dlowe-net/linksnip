# Linksnip - Copy a shortened address of the current page

Linksnip is a Chrome extension that will copy a shortened address for
the current page.  Ideally, this will support most popular services
that have a shortened form (like `youtube.com` links to
`youtu.be`). This extension does not operate with URL shortening
services.  It only computes the new URL from the existing one.

In addition to copying shortened links, Linksnip will also remove
various tracking parameters from the URL.  The result is a much
shorter, cleaner link to be shared.

To use, click on the extension button.  A shortened URL will be copied
into the clipboard.  If the extension doesn't know how to shorten a
URL, the whole address will be copied.
